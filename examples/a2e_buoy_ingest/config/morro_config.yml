    description: "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) manages this AXYS WindSentinelTM buoy (Buoy #130) on 
    behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that collect a comprehensive set of meteorological and oceanographic
    (metocean) data to support resource characterization for wind energy offshore. The buoy collects in-situ sea 
    surface temperature, salinity, ocean currents, and wave data as well as near-surface air temperature, humidity, and
    horizontal wind speed and direction."
