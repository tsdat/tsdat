Tsdat
#####

**tsdat** is an open-source Python framework that makes creating pipelines to 
process and standardize time-series data more easy,clear, and quick to stand up
so that you can spend less time data-wrangling and more time data-
investigating.


.. _quick-overview:

Quick Overview
**************

Tsdat is a python library for standardizing time-series datasets. It uses yaml 
configuration files to specify the variable names and metadata that will be 
produced by tsdat data pipelines.

   :alt: Framework for data ingestion and standardization.

Tsdat data pipelines are primarily customizable through the aforementioned 
configuration files and also through user-defined code “hooks” that are 
triggered at various points in the pipeline.

Tsdat is built on top of `Xarray`_ and the `netCDF`_ file format frequently used in 
the Climate Science community. Tsdat was originally written for use in the 
Marine Energy community and was developed with data standards and best 
practices borrowed from the `ARM program`_, but the library and framework itself 
is applicable to any domain in which large datasets are collected.

Motivation
**********

Too many datasets are difficult to use because the information needed to 
understand the data are buried away in technical reports and loose
documentation that are often difficult to access and are not well-maintained.
Even when you are able to get your hands on both the dataset and the metadata
you need to understand the data, it can still be tricky to write code that
reads each data file and handles edge cases. Additionally, as you process more
and more datasets it can become cumbersome to keep track of and maintain all of
the code you have written to process each of these datasets.

Wouldn’t it just be much easier if all the data you worked with was in the same
file format and had the same file structure? Wouldn’t it take less time to 
learn about the dataset if each data file also contained the metadata you 
needed in order to conduct your analysis? Wouldn’t it be nice if the data you 
worked with had been checked for quality and values that were suspect or bad 
had been flagged? That would all be great, right? This is the goal of tsdat, an
open-source python library that aims to make it easier to produce high-quality
datasets that are much more accessible to data users. Tsdat encourages 
following data standards and best practices when building data pipelines so 
that your data is clean, easy to understand, more accessible, and ultimately 
more valuable to your data users.
